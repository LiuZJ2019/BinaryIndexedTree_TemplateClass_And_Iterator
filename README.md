# BinaryIndexedTree_TemplateClass_And_Iterator
This project implements the **Binary Indexed Tree** with template. It can obtain the prefix sum in O(log N) time, add or update one item in O(log N) time, random-access in O(1) time. At the same time, we provide a **random access iterator** of the prefix sum. The iterator can interact well with many STL algorithms.
